## **Chapter 4: FPGA Design Examples**

In this chapter, I showcase my Verilog code and testbenches, along with visualizations in ModelSim for the following designs:

### 1. **Full Adder (4-bit)**
   - Implemented a 4-bit full adder to perform binary addition with carry propagation.
   
### 2. **Demux 1 to 8**
   - A **1-to-8 Demux** design to distribute an input signal to one of the 8 output lines based on a 3-bit select input.

### 3. **Mux 8 to 1**
   - A **8-to-1 Multiplexer** that selects one of 8 inputs based on a 3-bit select input.

### 4. **Decoder 3 to 8 (Enabled = 1)**
   - A **3-to-8 Decoder** where one of 8 outputs is active based on a 3-bit input and the enable signal is set to 1.

### 5. **Decoder 3 to 8 (Enabled = 0)**
   - A **3-to-8 Decoder** where the outputs are inactive because the enable signal is set to 0.
